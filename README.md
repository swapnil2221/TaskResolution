Steps to run the project:
1)open the solution and run the webApi : https://github.com/swapnil2221/TaskResolution/tree/main/TaskResolution.WebApi
2)Open solution available at : https://github.com/swapnil2221/TaskResolution/tree/main/TaskResolution.Web 
it will open load the entire project. Run the project and UI will be load.
It has 4 screens so far and has view and save screens of student and subject.
Instead of drop down for more user interaction i have added a drop down of subjects with checkbox.
Hence  at the time of student registration, from this drop down one can choose as much as subjects against one student.

Remaining work:
UI Logger
Stop exposing id from ui
delete and update
